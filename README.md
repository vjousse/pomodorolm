# ðŸ“˜ Installation

## Archlinux

    yay -S pomodorolm-bin

## Windows, Mac OS X, Debian, AppImage

Download the install file for your OS from the latest release on https://github.com/vjousse/pomodorolm/releases/

# ðŸ’» Dev

You will need to [install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) first.

    npm ci

## Running the app

    npm run tauri dev

## Running only the webapp

    npm run dev

# ðŸ”¨ Build

If you're using Linux be sure to set the `NO_STRIP` env var to `true` (see https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/8929 ) if the build is failing.

    NO_STRIP=true npm run tauri build -- --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu

If the build is still failing try to understand why using:

    NO_STRIP=true npm run tauri build -- --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --verbose

You can also try to build using `docker-compose` (to maximize compatibily, normal build is failing on Archlinux for example):

    docker-compose run --rm --build build-linux

Build files will be placed in the `target/` directory.

# ðŸ’€ Troubleshooting

## `Failed to create GBM buffer of sizeâ€¦`

If you run into this error, it is likely because you're using nvidia drivers under Linux. They are several bug reports in Webkit, cf this issue for wails: https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/issues/2977#issuecomment-1791041741.

You can try to run `pomodorolm` using this command:

    `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 pomodorolm`

Thanks to @Bad3r for the [bug report](https://github.com/vjousse/pomodorolm/issues/62)!
